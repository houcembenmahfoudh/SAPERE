# Sapere
This project is intended to provide a demonstrator testbed for spatial edges services running on the SAPERE middleware.Spatial edge services are a new generation of services that exploit spatially distributed data, enable smart environments, or exploit Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. This new category of decentralized services is based on data propagation among devices. The functionality of the service is provided as the result of collective interactions among multiple agent-based entities, involving processes and calculations taking place across several geographically distributed computational nodes. Spatial edge services rely on a coordination model for multi-agent pervasive systems inspired by chemical reactions. The SAPERE middleware is an implementation of a chemical coordination model enabling spatial edge services. There is currently no version of the SAPERE middleware adapted for devices with small computational capacities, such as connected objects. The goal of this project is to provide a new version of SAPERE middleware adapted to connected objects, integrate the middleware to the actual IoT infrastructure available in Hepia and provide a testbed for several spatial edge services case-study.
